        <p>Panthers are a type of large, elusive cat known for their striking appearance and adaptability. Here are some intriguing facts about these mysterious big cats:</p>
        
        <h2>Interesting Facts:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Scientific Name:</strong> The term "panther" refers to several large cats, including the <em>Panthera pardus</em> (leopard) and the <em>Panthera onca</em> (jaguar), as well as melanistic (black) individuals of these species.</li>
            <li><strong>Melanism:</strong> The black coloration seen in panthers is due to a genetic mutation known as melanism. This trait is more commonly observed in leopards and jaguars, giving them a sleek, black appearance.</li>
            <li><strong>Habitat:</strong> Panthers can be found in various habitats depending on the species. Leopards inhabit a range of environments from rainforests to savannas in Africa, while jaguars are native to Central and South America.</li>
            <li><strong>Size and Weight:</strong> Panthers vary in size depending on their species. Leopards typically weigh between 60 to 90 kilograms (130 to 200 pounds), while jaguars are larger, weighing between 100 to 160 kilograms (220 to 350 pounds).</li>
            <li><strong>Behavior:</strong> Panthers are solitary animals, known for their stealth and agility. They are adept climbers and swimmers, with a strong hunting instinct that helps them catch a variety of prey.</li>
            <li><strong>Diet:</strong> Panthers are carnivorous and have a diverse diet. Leopards primarily hunt antelopes, monkeys, and birds, while jaguars are known for their powerful bite, allowing them to prey on caimans and large mammals.</li>
            <li><strong>Conservation Status:</strong> Conservation status varies by species. Leopards are listed as vulnerable, while jaguars are near threatened. Habitat loss and poaching are major threats to their populations.</li>
        </ul>
